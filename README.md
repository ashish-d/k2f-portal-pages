# Kandy salesforce
This salesforce package encapsulates Kandyâ€™s JS SDK and Restful APIs. Kandy is a product by GENBAND (www.genband.com) that utilizes WebRTC to enable peer to peer audio/video calls, chat, SMS and PSTN.

With this package, you can enable video and audio calling between two users that are logged into your salesforce application.

Think of pages where you anticipate users collaborating with each other, possibly to discuss content on those pages. Your users could start a video call with other online users and enhance the collaboration experience. Home page: http://www.kandy.io/
