# Introduction

Weâ€™re happy to announce the support of a plugin! The Kandy PhoneGap plugin is an open-source plugin for use with Cordova and allows your application to make voice and video calls, manage address books, send/receive instant messages, share data in group sessions, and more on both Android and iOS devices.

This plugin encapsulates the Kandy mobile SDK. Developers could quickly embed collaboration widgets like video call, chat widget into their applications by declaring tags with predefined attribute names.
