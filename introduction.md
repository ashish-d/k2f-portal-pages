# Introduction

Weâ€™re happy to announce the support of a PhoneGap Kandy plugin! Check out the plugin repository on [Github]. The PhoneGap Kandy plugin is an open-source plugin and completely free to use, just like PhoneGap. The plugin allows developers to make voice and video calls, manage address books, send/receive Rich messages, share data in group chat, and more on both major mobile operating systems Android and iOS.

This plugin encapsulates the Kandy mobile SDK. Developers could quickly embed collaboration widgets such as video call, chat widget into their applications by declaring tags with predefined attribute names.
